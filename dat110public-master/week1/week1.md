## DAT110: Distributed Systems and Network Technology

### Lab Week 1: 07/01 - 11/01
#### Software tools installation

There are no regular laboratory/programming assignments in the first week of the course.

Your task is to make sure that you have a **working installation** of the software tools that is to be used in the first part of the course. This amounts to:

- [ ] A [Java Development Kit]( https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) (JDK)
- [ ] An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or editor for the Java programming language. [Eclipse]( https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or any other IDE for Java development will work.
- [ ] The [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) software project management tool
- [ ] A [Git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - either standalone or as an IDE plugin
- [ ] The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/tools) API development environment for networked applications
- [ ] The [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org  ) network protocol analyser

Perform a simple test to check that each of the tools are working properly. In case of problems, contact the teaching assistants of the course.

- [ ] Watch the video [Warriers of the Net](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBWhzz_Gn10) (15 minutes) which provides a popular science introduction to Internetworking which is one of the main topics of the course.
